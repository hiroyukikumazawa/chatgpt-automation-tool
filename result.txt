Yes, I'm familiar with Node.js! Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it well-suited for building scalable and real-time applications.Node.js is commonly used to build web servers, APIs, and other networked software applications. It has a large ecosystem of packages and libraries available through npm (Node Package Manager), which makes it easy for developers to leverage existing code and tools.If you have any specific questions about Node.js or need assistance with a particular aspect of it, feel free to ask!
